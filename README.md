Notes App by Jarrett Zapata

Features include: <br />
-Core Data (to save notes for each use of the app) <br />
-Date (showing the date and time of when the note entries were last modified) <br />
-The ability to tap on a list view entry to edit your note's title and body <br />
-Access to last deleted note only during current session use (not using Core Data in order to show only a recently deleted note). If there is no recently deleted note, then an alert will pop up. <br />
